# DarkHeresyAdvanced
Used for the Dark Heresy advanced character sheet

The WARHAMMER DARK HERESY 1e Advanced Character sheet is designed to add a level of automation to the DARK HERESY sheet using SheetWorkers and ScriptCards.  To use this character sheet roll20 PRO account is required as it uses a number of API MODS, all mods are listed in the section below.  The final code for each script card section is also listed in their own unique folder and a number of RollTemplates to use as an alternative.

Additionally, this sheet is listed as being compatable with Dark Heresy 1e, however, there a number of 3pp and homebrew modifications which allow it to use a number of common HOUSE RULES that are in play for DH1e.  Not to mention the fact that the character sheet is compatable with Rogue Trader, Deathwatch and Black Crusade rules since, all ttrpg lines use the same base, core rules.
